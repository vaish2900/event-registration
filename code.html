Sure! Here's a basic example of an HTML file to get you started:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML file with a heading and a paragraph.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>


You can copy and paste this into a .html file and open it in your browser to see how it looks. Want to add styling, images, or interactivity next?
